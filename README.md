# GroupsOfPeople

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.1.2.;

## Details 
The project meets the requirements:
- create/edit people
-create/edit groups
-move people from one group to another
-For the last task to move one group to another group, the functionality is not complete, there are a few more corner cases to cover. I decided to send the implementation in this form to fit in time.
